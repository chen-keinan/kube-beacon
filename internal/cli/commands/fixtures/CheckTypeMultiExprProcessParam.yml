        - name: 1.2.11 Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set
          description: Do not allow all requests.
          profile_applicability: Level 1 - Master Node
          audit:
            - ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver |grep 'enable-admission-plugins' | grep -o 'enable-admission-plugins=[^"]\S*'
              | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' |awk 'FNR <= 1'
          remediation: Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-
            apiserver.yaml on the master node and either remove the --enable-admission-plugins
            parameter, or set it to a value that does not include AlwaysAdmit.
          check_type: multi_param
          impact: Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would
            be served.
          eval_expr: "'${0}' != ''; && !('AlwaysAdmit' IN (${0}));"
          default_value: AlwaysAdmit is not in the list of default admission plugins.
