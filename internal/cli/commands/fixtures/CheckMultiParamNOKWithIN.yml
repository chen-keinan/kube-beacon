        - name: Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated)
          description: Turn on Role Based Access Control.
          profile_applicability: Level 1 - Master Node
          audit:
            - aaa
            - 'bbb ${0}'
          remediation: Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-
            apiserver.yaml on the master node and set the --authorization-mode parameter
            to a value that includes RBAC, for example:--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
          check_type: multi_param
          impact: When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings
            (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to
            allow appropriate access.
          eval_expr: "!('${0}' IN (${1}));"
          default_value: By default, RBAC authorization is not enabled.
