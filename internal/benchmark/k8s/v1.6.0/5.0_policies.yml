      remediation: Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing "--feature- gates=AllAlpha=true" argument.
        Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
        KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
      check_type: multi_param
      impact: If the docker/default seccomp profile is too restrictive for you, you would have to create/manage your own seccomp profiles. Also, you need to enable all alpha features for this to work. There is no individual switch to turn on this feature.
      eval_expr: "'${0}' == 'true'; &&  '${1}' != '';"
      default_value: By default, seccomp profile is set to unconfined which means that no seccomp profiles are enabled.

      remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers.
        Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
        KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
      check_type: multi_param
      impact: If you incorrectly apply security contexts, you may have trouble running the pods.
      eval_expr: "'${0}' == 'true';"
      default_value: By default, no security contexts are automatically applied to pods.

      name: 5.7.4 The default namespace should not be used
      description: Kubernetes provides a default namespace, where objects are placed if no namespace is specified for them. Placing objects in this namespace makes application of RBAC and other controls more difficult.
