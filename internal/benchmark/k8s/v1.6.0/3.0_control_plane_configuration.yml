        - name: 3.1.1 Client certificate authentication should not be used for users
          description: |-
            Kubernetes provides the option to use client certificates for user authentication. However as there is no way to revoke these certificates when a user leaves an organization or loses their credential, they are not suitable for this purpose.
            It is not possible to fully disable client certificate use within a cluster as it is used for component to component authentication.
          profile_applicability: Level 1 - Master Node
          audit:
            - ps -ef | grep etcd |grep 'oidc-username-claim' | grep -o 'oidc-username-claim=[^"]\S*'
              | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' |awk 'FNR <= 1'
            - sudo awk -v FS="oidc-username-claim=" 'NF>1{print $2}' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
          remediation: Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of
            OIDC should be implemented in place of client certificates.
          check_type: multi_param
          impact: External mechanisms for authentication generally require additional
            software to be deployed.
          eval_expr: "'$0' != ''; && '$0' == '$1';"
          default_value: Client certificate authentication is enabled by default.

          description: Kubernetes can audit the details of requests made to the API server.

          remediation: Create an audit policy file for your cluster.
          check_type: multi_param
          impact: Audit logs will be created on the master nodes, which will consume disk
            space. Care should be taken to avoid generating too large volumes of log information
            as this could impact the available of the cluster nodes.
          eval_expr: "'$0' != '';"
          default_value: Unless the --audit-policy-file flag is specified, no auditing
            will be carried out.

          remediation: |-
            Consider modification of the audit policy in use on the cluster to include these items, at a minimum.:Access to Secrets managed by the cluster. Care should be taken to only log Metadata for requests to Secrets, ConfigMaps, and TokenReviews, in order to avoid the risk of logging sensitive data.
            • Modification of pod and deployment objects.
            • Use of pods/exec, pods/portforward, pods/proxy and services/proxy.
          check_type: multi_param
          impact: Increasing audit logging will consume resources on the nodes or other
            log destination.

          default_value: By default Kubernetes clusters do not log audit information.
