    - name: 2.1.1 Client certificate authentication should not be used for users (Not
        Scored)
      description: |-
        Kubernetes provides the option to use client certificates for user authentication. However
        as there is no way to revoke these certificates when a user leaves an organization or loses
        their credential, they are not suitable for this purpose.
        It is not possible to fully disable client certificate use within a cluster as it is used for
        component to component authentication.
      profile_applicability: Master
      audit:
      - ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver |grep ' --oidc-username-claim' | grep -o ' --oidc-username-claim=[^"]\S*' | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' |awk 'FNR <= 1'
      - awk -v FS="--oidc-username-claim=" 'NF>1{print $2}' /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
      remediation: Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be
        implemented in place of client certificates.
        You can remediate the availability of client certificates in your GKE cluster. See
        Recommendation 6.8.2.
      check_type: multi_param
      impact: External mechanisms for authentication generally require additional software to be
        deployed.

      default_value: See the GKE documentation for the default value.

    - name: 2.2.1 Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created (Not Scored)
      description: |-
        Kubernetes can audit the details of requests made to the API server. The --audit-policyfile
        flag must be set for this logging to be enabled.
      profile_applicability: Master
      audit:
      - This control cannot be audited in GKE.
      remediation: This control cannot be modified in GKE.
      check_type: multi_param
      impact: Audit logs will be created on the master nodes, which will consume disk space. Care should
        be taken to avoid generating too large volumes of log information as this could impact the
        available of the cluster nodes.

        Ensure that the audit policy created for the cluster covers key security concerns.

      - This control cannot be audited in GKE.
      remediation: This control cannot be modified in GKE.
      check_type: multi_param
      impact: Increasing audit logging will consume resources on the nodes or other log destination.
